      <h1>Where it all started</h1>
      <p>Wynyard footbal club was originally started by the now chairman Graham Parry in 1999.<br>
         Graham and his wife Gill started a fun session to coach primary school children football.<br>
         It was held every Saturday morning and Graham and Gills children helped with the coaching.<br>
         As other residents joined in to help it wasn't long before the sessions developed into teams,<br>
         eventually gaining league status with our first team in 2004.<br>
         Wynyard has continued to grow and now has 11 teams ranging from under 7's to a mens team.<br>
         Next season will see the launch of our first girls team!<br>
         Graham is the first to say that the football in the community is also attributed to the many volunteers who consistently give their time<br>
         Graham continues to be heavily involved and can be regulary seen coaching at the Saturday morning club.</p>
